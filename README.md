# Exoplanet Data Analysis ü™ê

### Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA missions. The goal is to uncover key trends in planetary discovery and analyze the physical characteristics of these new worlds. The analysis covers the entire process, from data cleaning and preparation to visualization and storytelling.

### Key Insights
Through an end-to-end analysis, this project revealed three core findings about the exoplanets in our sample:

* **A Neptune-like Universe:** Contrary to popular belief, the most commonly discovered exoplanets are **Neptune-like**, followed by gas giants and super-Earths. Terrestrial (Earth-like) planets currently make up the smallest proportion of discoveries.
* **The Discovery Boom:** A massive spike in discoveries occurred starting in **2014**, with annual finds rocketing from under 200 to over 1400. This trend highlights the transformative impact of new planet-hunting technologies.
* **Mass vs. Radius Correlation:** The analysis showed a clear positive correlation between a planet's mass and its radius, though the data also revealed a dense cluster of smaller planets, suggesting a high frequency of low-mass, low-radius discoveries.

The tech stack for this project is centered around standard Python libraries and tools used in data analysis.

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for the entire analysis.
* **Pandas:** The core data manipulation library, used for cleaning, preparing, and analyzing the dataset.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** The visualization libraries used to create all the charts and graphs for the insights.
* **Google Colab:** The cloud-based environment used for writing and running the Python code.
* **Git & GitHub:** The version control system and hosting service used to manage the project and make it shareable.

### Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from the **Kaggle**, which catalogs all confirmed planets discovered outside of our solar system.

### File Descriptions
* **`exoplanet_analysis.ipynb`**: This is the main project file. It contains all the Python code, visualizations, and detailed explanations of the analysis in a step-by-step format.
* **`exoplanet_analysis.py`**: A clean script containing only the Python code from the notebook.
